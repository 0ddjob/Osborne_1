	The ROM 1.44 Source diskette contains the ROM rev 1.44 source
	program .

	The ACT80 diskette contains the ACT 80 assembler .


	The difference between ROM rev 1.43 and rev 1.44 is listed in the
	beginning of the source listing .

	
	Generation procedure :

		Hardware environment - O1 double density computer with Corvus ROM
				     - Corvus Hard Disk System	
	
		Assembler - ACT 80 assembler
	
	

		Procedure to generate the hex object file for ROM rev 1.44

			- insert ACT80 diskette into drive A
			- insert ROM 1.44 diskette into drive B
			- type <cr> to boot system
			- type 'ACT B:ROM144 H=B:' <cr>

		   This will result in a HEX file in disk B

		
		Procedure to generate the print file for ROM rev 1.44

		   Since the print file is over 200k in size , Corvus
		   environment is assumed .


			- boot system off Corvus  
			- insert ROM 1.44 diskette into drive P
			- type 'ACT P:ROM144 L=B: R=F' <cr>

		a ROM burner .
