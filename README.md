# Osborne Model 1
## [ROMs](/ROM)
- [2732] Original Osborne BIOS vers. 1.40 (from my Osborne)

- [2732] OZROM 1E (alternative, thanks to user neglin on VCFED Forums)
- [2764] Combined OCC v1.44 & OZROM (would require a daughterboard & switch)

## [Daughterboard](/2732-to-2764)
[Coming Soon] ROM daughterboard to accomodate 28-pin 2764 (8KByte) EPROM in the Osborne's 24-pin 2732 (4KByte) BIOS socket.
