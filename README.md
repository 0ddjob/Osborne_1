# Osborne Model 1
## [ROMs](/ROM)
- [2732] Original Osborne BIOS vers. 1.40 (from my Osborne)
- [2732] Original Osborne BIOS vers. 1.44 (latest)
- [2732] 3rd Party Micro Management OZROM 1E (thanks to user [nelgin](https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/osborne-1-screen-flash.1245908/post-1400583) on VCFED Forums)
- OZROM manual (cleaned up version thanks to VCFED user booboo)
- [2764] Combined OCC v1.44 & OZROM (would require a daughterboard & switch)
- [2716] Original Osborne character generator ROM (from my Osborne)

Differences between ROM v1.4 and v1.44 include:
```
; CBOOT - added seek 10 tracks and home drive
; GKEY - fixed bell bug
; SENDEN - changed the number of retrys to NRETRY
; PSEKC - added disk head settle delay
; SELDRV - changed start up delay to 500 ms
```

## [Daughterboard](/2732-to-2764)
[21-Aug-2024: test boards in transit]  
ROM daughterboard to accomodate 28-pin 2764 (8KByte) EPROM in the Osborne's 24-pin 2732 (4KByte) BIOS socket.  Idea is to allow switching between the official Osborne ROM and the 3rd party OZROM.  

Address pin A12 is pulled high by the 10KÎ© resistor or can be switched to ground via a strapping or switch connected to the A12 pin headers.

## [Using A Gotek](/Gotek)
Big thanks to [Dave Dunfield](http://dunfield.classiccmp.org/index.htm) for the original ImageDisk-format (IMD) disk images.

How to tell if an Osborne 1 disk image is single density (SD) or double density (DD)?
* SD disks have ten 256 byte sectors per track (2560 bytes/track)
* DD disks have five 1024 byte sectors per track (5120 bytes/track)

Example output of ```fsed.cpm``` info command on an IMG disk image:
```
              Sector length: 1024
           Number of tracks: 40
          Sectors per track: 5
```
